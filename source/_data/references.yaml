                Rector helped us to **get rid of our frustration** with Nette application by migrating it to Symfony.
                <br>
                Before, we could only dream of it. But **within nearly 17 days with Rector refactoring, we had our 55 000+ lines** app (150+ routes) running on Symfony 4.2 in production.
                <br>
                **What a joy**!
