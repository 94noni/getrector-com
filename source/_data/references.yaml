                With Rector, we were able to **get rid of our frustration** with Nette application by migrating it to Symfony.
                <br>
                We though we could only dream about it. But **in nearly 17 days with Rector refactoring, we had our 55 000+ lines** app (150+ routes) running on Symfony 4.2 in production.
                <br>
                **What a joy**!
